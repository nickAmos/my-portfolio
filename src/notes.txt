TEXT ON GROUND:

use a function to input the height of the container the text will rise from
ie:
    y: () => document.querySelector(".className").offsetHeight

- This will allow for the text to always be on the ground desipite the screen
  size. Just ensure that the conainer that holds this animation touches the bottom
  of the screen. 

- Create a new div that has 100vh which is basically the screen for the first
  animation. Another div will go inside which has is placed on the bottom of the screen
  by flex-end on the first screen. this will ensure we can put the text on the bottom.
